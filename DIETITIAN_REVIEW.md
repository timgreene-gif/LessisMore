  - Minor note: Cod is relatively lower in Omega-3 compared to salmon/sardines; could clarify "lean fish omega-3"
- [x] Is the tiering methodology sound (4+ nutrients = Tier 1, etc.)?
  - **APPROVED**: This is a reasonable heuristic for nutrient density ranking
  - Suggestion: Consider adding "bioavailability" as a factor (e.g., heme iron vs. non-heme)
- [x] Any foods with overstated or understated nutrient claims?
  - Feta cheese: B12 content is modest; consider noting this is lower than other dairy
  - Dark chocolate: Benefits depend on cacao percentage (should specify 70%+ cacao)
  - Greek yogurt "Probiotics" claim is accurate only for products with live cultures
- [x] Any missing "power foods" that should be included?
  - **Recommended additions**: Oysters (zinc champion), Brazil nuts (selenium), Nutritional yeast (B vitamins for plant-based), Organ meats beyond liver (heart for CoQ10)

  - "Dutch Baby with Berries" claiming B12/Choline is accurate (eggs)
- [x] Are any nutrients significantly overstated for the portion sizes?
  - **CAUTION**: Snack portions (e.g., "Spiced Almonds") may overstate Vitamin E impact—need ~1oz serving for meaningful contribution
  - "Prosciutto-Wrapped Dates" - Iron claim is modest for typical 2-3 date serving
- [x] Are there synergistic effects being missed (e.g., Vit C + Iron)?
  - **EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY**: Several recipes naturally pair Vit C with plant iron (Shakshuka, Huevos Rancheros) - could highlight this synergy
  - Consider noting: Fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) absorption enhanced by healthy fats present in many recipes
  - Calcium and iron compete for absorption—this is naturally managed in recipe timing (not same meal)

## SECTION 3: Bloodwork Reference Ranges

### 3.1 Optimal vs. Lab "Normal" Ranges (bloodwork.html)

| Marker | Lab "Normal" | App's "Optimal" | Accuracy Check |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Vitamin D | 30-100 ng/mL | **50-80** | [ ] |
| Vitamin B12 | 200-900 pg/mL | **500-800** | [ ] |
| Ferritin | 12-300 ng/mL | **50-150** | [ ] |
| RBC Magnesium | 4.2-6.8 mg/dL | **5.5-6.5** | [ ] |
| Zinc | 60-120 mcg/dL | **90-120** | [ ] |
| Homocysteine | 5-15 µmol/L | **<8** | [ ] |
| HbA1c | 4.0-5.6% | **4.8-5.2** | [ ] |
| Fasting Insulin | 2.6-25 µIU/mL | **3-8** | [ ] |
| hs-CRP | <3.0 mg/L | **<1.0** | [ ] |
| TSH | 0.4-4.0 mIU/L | **1.0-2.5** | [ ] |
| Omega-3 Index | N/A | **8-12%** | [ ] |

**Questions for Review:**
- [x] Are the "optimal" ranges evidence-based?
  - **MOSTLY SUPPORTED**: These ranges align with functional medicine literature (not always mainstream)
  - Vitamin D 50-80 ng/mL: Supported by Endocrine Society and vitamin D researchers
  - B12 >500 pg/mL: Supported for neurological protection (Japan uses 500+ as lower limit)
  - Ferritin 50-150: Appropriate for most adults; lower end may be too high for some women
  - Fasting Insulin 3-8: Aligns with metabolic health optimization literature
  - hs-CRP <1.0: Per American Heart Association cardiovascular risk stratification
- [x] Any ranges that could be misleading or harmful if misinterpreted?
  - **WARNING - Ferritin**: Men and post-menopausal women with ferritin >150 should investigate hemochromatosis, not supplement iron
  - **WARNING - TSH 1.0-2.5**: This narrow range may cause unnecessary concern; some healthy individuals are 2.5-4.0
  - **CAUTION - Omega-3 Index**: Not widely available; may frustrate users who can't access this test
- [x] Should any markers be added or removed?
  - **Recommend adding**: Serum folate, RBC folate, GGT (liver health), Vitamin A (retinol)
  - Consider: Iodine (urine), Selenium, Copper:Zinc ratio
- [x] Is the distinction between "normal" and "optimal" appropriately communicated?
  - **NEEDS STRENGTHENING**: Add clear language that "optimal" represents functional medicine perspective, not diagnostic criteria
  - Suggest adding: "Discuss with your healthcare provider; 'optimal' ranges are goals, not diagnoses"

| Iron | Medium | Fatigue, weakness, pale skin, shortness of breath | Red meat, Spinach, Lentils, Oysters |

**Questions for Review:**
- [x] Are medication-nutrient depletion claims supported by peer-reviewed research?
  - **WELL-DOCUMENTED**: Statins → CoQ10 (established mechanism via mevalonate pathway)
  - **WELL-DOCUMENTED**: PPIs → B12, Mg, Ca, Iron (acid-dependent absorption)
  - **WELL-DOCUMENTED**: Metformin → B12 (mechanism involves IF or calcium-dependent absorption)
  - **WELL-DOCUMENTED**: Oral Contraceptives → B6, Folate (multiple studies)
  - **MODERATE EVIDENCE**: Beta Blockers → CoQ10 (less robust than statin data)
  - **EMERGING**: SSRIs → nutrient depletions (less established than other classes)
- [x] Are severity ratings appropriate?
  - **ADJUST**: B12 from PPIs should be "High" only for long-term use (>1 year)
  - **ADJUST**: CoQ10 from statins may warrant "High" given muscle symptom prevalence
  - Iron depletion ratings appear appropriate
- [x] Any drug-nutrient interactions missing?
  - **ADD**: Thyroid medications + calcium/iron (absorption interference)
  - **ADD**: Bisphosphonates + calcium, magnesium (timing critical)
  - **ADD**: Lithium + sodium (not depletion but important interaction)
  - **ADD**: Warfarin + Vitamin K (critical interaction, needs warning)
- [x] Any overstated claims that could cause unnecessary alarm?
  - **CAUTION**: Antibiotic "B vitamin" depletion is primarily via gut flora; short courses unlikely to cause deficiency
  - **CAUTION**: Not all SSRIs equally affect nutrients; class-level statements may overgeneralize

| Antacids/PPIs | B12, Iron, Magnesium, Calcium, Zinc | [ ] |
| Sedentary Lifestyle | Vitamin D, Calcium utilization | [ ] |

### 5.2 Specific Depletion Mechanisms Claimed

**Magnesium:**
- "Significant magnesium required to metabolize sugar"
- "Alcohol increases urinary excretion. Up to 50% of heavy drinkers are deficient"
- "Mg needs can DOUBLE under stress"

**Vitamin C:**
- "Glucose and Vitamin C use the SAME transporter protein—and it prefers glucose"
- "Each cigarette depletes ~25mg"

**Iron:**
- "Coffee/tea reduces absorption up to 80%"
- "Separate caffeine from meals by at least 1 hour"

**Calcium:**
- "Each cup of coffee causes ~5mg calcium loss"
- "For every 2,300mg sodium, you lose ~40mg calcium"

**Chromium:**
- "White flour has 98% less chromium than whole wheat"

**Questions for Review:**
- [x] Are these mechanism claims accurate and evidence-based?
  - **ACCURATE**: Sugar → Magnesium depletion (metabolic processing requires Mg)
  - **ACCURATE**: Glucose-Vitamin C transporter competition (GLUT1 mechanism documented)
  - **ACCURATE**: Caffeine-iron absorption interference (tannins/polyphenols bind iron)
  - **ACCURATE**: Stress → Magnesium/B vitamin utilization increase (HPA axis activation)
  - **PARTIALLY ACCURATE**: Sedentary → Vitamin D claim needs nuance (sun exposure, not movement per se)
- [x] Are quantitative claims (e.g., "80% reduction", "5mg loss") sourced from peer-reviewed literature?
  - **VERIFIED**: "Coffee reduces iron absorption up to 80%" - Supported by Morck et al. and subsequent studies
  - **VERIFIED**: "Each cigarette depletes ~25mg Vitamin C" - Established in literature (Schectman 1993)
  - **NEEDS SOURCE**: "Each cup of coffee causes ~5mg calcium loss" - This is older data; actual loss may be smaller
  - **NEEDS SOURCE**: "Mg needs can DOUBLE under stress" - Directionally correct but magnitude varies
  - **VERIFIED**: "98% chromium lost in white flour processing" - USDA processing data supports this
- [x] Any claims that are outdated or controversial?
  - **UPDATE**: Caffeine-calcium relationship is now considered modest; original studies may have overestimated
  - **CLARIFY**: "50% of heavy drinkers are Mg deficient" - Accurate for alcoholics; casual drinkers less affected

---

## SECTION 7: Population-Specific Claims

### 7.1 Demographics (subtraction_supplement_guide.html)

**Women:**
- "Higher iron needs during menstruating years"
- "Ca/D critical at menopause"
- "Birth control depletes B vitamins, Mg, Zn"
- "Pregnancy increases folate, iron, calcium, omega-3 needs"

**Men:**
- "Zinc critical for testosterone—alcohol especially problematic"
- "Iron overload more common than deficiency (test first)"

**Over 50:**
- "B12 absorption decreases (may need sublingual)"
- "Vitamin D production from sun decreases"
- "Stomach acid decreases"

**Athletes:**
- "Iron, Mg, K, Zn, B vitamins all used/lost more rapidly"
- "May need above RDA"

**Plant-based:**
- "B12 supplementation essential"
- "Iron less bioavailable (pair with C)"
- "Zinc needs 50% higher"
- "Consider algae-based EPA/DHA"

**Questions for Review:**
- [x] Are population-specific claims accurate?
  - **WOMEN - VERIFIED**: Iron needs during menstruation, Ca/D at menopause, OCP depletions all accurate
  - **WOMEN - ADD**: Folate needs pre-conception (neural tube defect prevention)
  - **MEN - VERIFIED**: Zinc-testosterone link established; iron overload risk accurate
  - **OVER 50 - VERIFIED**: B12 absorption decrease, reduced vitamin D synthesis, lower stomach acid
  - **ATHLETES - VERIFIED**: Increased mineral losses via sweat; above-RDA needs documented

## NOTES FOR REVIEWER

### High Priority Issues:

1. **Iron Supplementation Warning**: Add prominent "test ferritin before supplementing" warning, especially for men and post-menopausal women. Hemochromatosis affects 1 in 200 people of Northern European descent.

2. **Potassium Safety**: Clarify that high-dose potassium (>99mg) requires prescription. Self-supplementation with potassium chloride can cause fatal cardiac arrhythmias.

3. **"Red Flag" Symptoms Section**: Add guidance on when symptoms warrant immediate medical attention (unexplained weight loss, severe fatigue with other symptoms, neurological symptoms).

4. **Warfarin/Vitamin K Interaction**: Critical safety interaction missing from medications page. Vitamin K changes can destabilize INR in anticoagulated patients.

### Medium Priority Issues:

1. **TSH "Optimal" Range**: The 1.0-2.5 range may cause unnecessary anxiety. Consider widening to 0.5-3.0 or adding context that individual variation exists.

2. **Functional Medicine Disclaimer**: Make clearer distinction between "lab normal" and "functional optimal" to prevent misinterpretation.

3. **Nutrient-Nutrient Interactions**: Add timing guidance for calcium-iron-zinc competition at meals.

4. **Pregnancy Recommendations**: Strengthen emphasis on prenatal care; self-supplementation during pregnancy carries risks.

### Minor Corrections:

1. Cod omega-3 content is lower than salmon/sardines—consider clarifying
2. Dark chocolate benefits require 70%+ cacao specification
3. "5mg calcium loss per cup of coffee" may be outdated—consider removing specific number
4. Greek yogurt probiotic claim only valid for products with live active cultures

### Recommendations:

1. **Add Nutrient Interactions Section**: Include guidance on absorption enhancers (Vit C + Iron) and inhibitors (Calcium + Iron) with timing recommendations

2. **Expand Plant-Based Section**: Add iodine, EPA/DHA, and vitamin D3 (most D3 is animal-derived)

3. **Create "When to See a Doctor" Guidance**: List symptoms that require professional evaluation before assuming nutrient deficiency

4. **Add Quality Indicators**: Guidance on choosing quality supplements (third-party testing, bioavailable forms)

5. **Consider Adding**: Copper, iodine, K2, and selenium to nutrient tracking
